> Basic Overview of "The Factory Method Pattern"

# The Singleton Pattern
## Definition
    In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

## Implementation
    Object-oriented design emphasizes the abstract class over the implementation. That is, it works with generalizations than specializations. The factory method pattern addresses the problem of how to create object instances when your code focuses on abstract types.

    The factory method pattern splits creator classes from the products they are designed to generate.
